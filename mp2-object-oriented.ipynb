    "Now we will use these points to solve a real world problem!  We can use our Point objects to represent measurements of two different quantities (e.g. a company's stock price and volume).  One thing we might want to do with a data set is to separate the points into groups of similar points.  Here we will implement an iterative algorithm to do this which will be a specific case of the very general $k$-means clustering algorithm.  The algorithm will require us to keep track of two clusters, each of which have a list of points and a center (which is another point, not necessarily one of the points we are clustering).  After making an initial guess at the center of the two clusters, $C_1$ and $C_2$, the steps proceed as follows\n",

    "1. Assign each point to $C_1$ or $C_2$ based on whether the point is closer to the center of $C_1$ or $C_2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "See [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Standard_algorithm) for more information.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this we will create a class called cluster which has two methods besides `__init__` which you will need to write.  The first method `update` will update the center of the Cluster given the points contained in the attribute `points`.  Remember, you after updating the center of the cluster, you will want to reassign the points and thus remove previous assignments.  The other method `add_point` will add a point to the `points` attribute.\n",
